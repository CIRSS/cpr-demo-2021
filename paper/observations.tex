\subsection{Observations}

A key challenge in making provenance useful to researchers and verifiers alike is highlighting the small subset of recorded events of direct relevance to the scientific purpose of an execution. An execution of a one-line Python 3 script that prints "Hello World" can involve reading as many as X different files from disk in addition to the users' single-line Python file. CPR minimizes such provenance "noise" using a CPR profile that assigns distinct roles to files loaded from particular locations on the system.

It can be useful to hide processes that do not read or write data files.  A bash script that invokes other programs that do process data files then becomes invisible.

Exporting a WT trace using the PROV or ProvONE vocabalaries is as simple as a trivial CONSTRUCT query that extracts triples that already exist in the RDF dataset.  This is useful for depositing in data repositories, e.g. DataONE which favors provenance expressed using the ProvONE vocabulary exclusively.
