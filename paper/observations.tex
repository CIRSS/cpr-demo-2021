\subsection{Observations}

A key challenge in making provenance useful to researchers and verifiers alike is highlighting the small subset of recorded events of direct relevance to the scientific purpose of an execution.

An execution of a one-line Python 3 script that prints "Hello World" can involve reading as many as X different files from disk in addition to the users' single-line Python file.
 
CPR minimizes such provenance "noise" using a CPR profile that assigns distinct roles to files loaded from particular locations on the system.
