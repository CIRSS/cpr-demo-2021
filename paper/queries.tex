\emph{What are the input and output data files for each process in the run?}

\emph{Which files input to a run are used to produce a particular output file?}

\emph{Which output artifacts are affected by a particular input file?}

\emph{What programs and script invocations occur as part of the run?}

\emph{What programs and script invocations contribute to the production of a particular output artifact?}

\emph{What constraints on the order of execution of different processes does the observed flow of data imply?}
